### A custom script link creation tool.
> Basically a pretext to use ninite like scripts with one command

### What it does
- Save or host scripts
- Serves scripts on a link
- Use the links for remote script acces

### How does it work ?
It saves your uploaded script in a database, and generate links containing its content.

Then you can use the link as a web shortcut to execute what you planned.

It host, then you execute with your shell by piping it.

#### Examples :
Powershell :
``irm https://script.cheapgriffy.com/api/script/B50VTRV4 | iex``

Bash : 
``curl -fsSL https://script.cheapgriffy.com/api/script/B50VTRV4 | bash``

#### Why ? 
It removes friction when making remote script links,

I was tired of pushing scripts to github and then using raw links, or using pastebin, so I made this.

I mainly use those for installation scripts, or to summarise unintuitive commands. If you ever had to setup wsl port foward you know what im talking about.
